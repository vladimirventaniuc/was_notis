				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<p>The objectives of the usability test are to check how easy is for a person to interact with the extension. In this test we will test: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>how intuitive is the interface</li>
					<li>how often the user encounters an obstacle when trying to accomplish a task</li>
					<li>the time spent doing all the tasks</li>
					<li>how useful is the extension in user perception</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finally, we will collect user responses and we will try to improve user experience and to add new features that users consider relevant for an extension of this type.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>User receives a laptop with the Chrome browser installed and the visia extension added in Chrome. He has to navigate to a page and to learn how to use the extension.</p>
		</div>

						<li>Task 1: Open any webpage on browser (1 min)</li>
						<li>Task 2: Left click on extension icon an observ all the buttons (2 min)</li>

					</ul>

					</ul>

				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>
